<h1>Web Landing Page with HTML and CSS</h1>
<p>
<p>In this project, I used html and css in order to recreate a [web landing page](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png) provided by The Odin Project. I practiced my skills of using and thinking with flexbox properties. For instance, I created container modules in the index.html file in order to prepare my style.css file for the flexbox properties. I also learned to be resourceful by referencing past exercises I've worked on, using html and css web articles provided by The Odin Project, and googling things I didn't quite understand how to achieve (such as rounded corners).</p>

<p>I also did my best to stick with what The Odin Project suggested doing about working on one section at a time. After completing the initial index.html file and coding in the corresponding html content, I started styling the css for the header, then the following section, and so forth. Once the basic css layout was created, I then went into more detail with [choosing the colors, fonts, and styles](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png) provided by The Odin Project. That was the structure I followed in order to complete this project. Although, I had to bounce back and forth from the html and css files and add some tweaks around.</p>
